I present to you my personal game.
Try to dodge as many meteors as possible if you want to survive!!
(In the end, what matters in life is knowing how to dodge)
Feel free to copy the code and modify it as you like.


How to Play
Use the arrow keys to move the spaceship:

Left/Right Arrow: Move the spaceship left or right.
Up/Down Arrow: Move the spaceship up or down.
Avoid the falling rocks: If a rock hits the spaceship, you lose a life. You start with 3 lives.

Collect bonus items: Some rocks provide bonus points, and others give you extra lives when collected.

Boost your speed: If you have at least 10 points, press the "Speed" button to temporarily boost the spaceship’s speed.

Game Over: If you lose all your lives, the game ends, and the "Game Over" message appears.

Scoring:
Normal Rocks: Avoid these to stay alive. They fall at a speed of 2 units per frame.
Special Rocks : These rocks are dangerous and do not give points. They fall faster, at a speed of 4.2 units per frame. Avoid them to survive.
Bonus Rocks: Fall at a speed of 2.5 units per frame. Collecting them gives 50 extra points.
Hearts: Fall at a speed of 2.2 units per frame and provide an extra life when collected.
Trio Rocks: A set of three rocks that fall together at the normal speed of 2 units per frame.
Increasing Difficulty:
Every 20 seconds, the speed of normal rocks increases by 50%.
Every 50 seconds, the speed of special rocks increases by 40%.
Boost:
If you have 10 or more points, pressing the "Speed" button increases your spaceship’s movement speed by 10% temporarily, costing 10 points.
Try to survive as long as possible and achieve the highest score!
